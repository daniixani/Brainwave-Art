Mind Control Art
Purpose:
To showcase that we can show others what we are thinking of on a minuscule scale using an EEG device and LED lights. 
Preface:
This is a project inspired by Michael Reeves where he used an EEG toy headset to drive a car using his brainwaves. Markers of “relaxed” and “focus” state were implemented to control whether a piston will step on the gas pedal of the car based on the value of the brainwave.
I will be using a similar strategy but for color perception. 

Introduction:

This documentation delineates a seminal project that endeavors to traverse this interdisciplinary terrain, employing advanced Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology to establish a tangible link between the intricacies of cognitive processes and artistic expression.
At its nucleus, this initiative undertakes an exploration into the complexities of color perception on a diminutive scale, transmuting the nuanced cadence of neural activities into a visually immersive experience.
